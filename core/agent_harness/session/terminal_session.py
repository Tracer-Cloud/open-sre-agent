"""Interactive-shell (terminal) session facet.

Groups the shell-surface-only session state (prompt-toolkit, theme, background jobs,
metrics, per-turn analytics staging) that ``core``, ``gateway``, and ``tools``
consumers never touch. Composed onto :class:`~core.agent_harness.session.state.Session`
as ``session.terminal`` and always present (empty for non-shell sessions), so shell
code accesses fields without a None-guard.

Populated cluster-by-cluster as the #3690 split lands; theme is the first cluster.
