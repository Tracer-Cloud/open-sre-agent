"""Abstract benchmark adapter + typed data contracts.

The framework calls into adapters via ``BenchmarkAdapter``. Each benchmark
suite (CloudOpsBench, OpenRCA, ToolCallBench) implements this interface;
the framework handles parallelism, LLM dispatch, output, cost tracking,
integrity guards.

This module deliberately has zero ``app.*`` imports — the framework is
independent of opensre internals. Adapters bridge to opensre.
